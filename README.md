# Number Guessing Game (Python)
This is my first project ever. It's a simple number guessing terminal-based game written in python. 
The user must enter a password and then guess a number from 1 to 100 with feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or how close it is to the correct number.
I made this to help me better understand python fundamentals such as variables, loops, conditionals, functions and control flow. I also learned a lot about debugging logic errors structuring code properly and simply avoiding redundancy.

Possible future improvements:

1- Adding a limited number of attempts and/or a limited time to guess the number, that changes depending on the chosen difficulty.

2- Improve the login system (currently, the password can be found by reading the source code).

3- Refactor and optimize the code as i learn more python.
